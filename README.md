# Affirm Â· Independent Coding Exercise

## DEMO LINK
https://damp-thicket-27507.herokuapp.com/

## Stack
This is a vanilla React App with vanilla CSS

I deliberately did not use react ui frameworks. The challenge didn't call for a router, redux, auth, or a backend; thus, I've skipped those portions.

I also took some liberties, once your submit, I don't delete your data, and I don't send it anywhere.
